Wombat - a Perl servlet engine
==============================

Wombat is a servlet engine for Perl. It provides a servlet container
that implements an adaption of the Java (TM) Servlet API Specification
to Perl. The engine is designed to run in many different deployment
configurations: embedded inside a protocol server, standalone with an
external protocol server, or standalone with one or more internal
protocol listeners.

The web site for Wombat is located at
<http://wombat.sourceforge.net/>.
