priority 1:

 * make HostValve and ApplicationValve only use HttpRequest/Response

priority 2:
 * input handle and output handle interfaces
 * retie stdin, stdout

priority 3: 

 * char streams using Text::Iconv
 * locales - default, mappings using Locale::Codes
 * use utf8
 * other authenticators
 * filters
 * container events
 * naming
 * resources
 * full spec compliance
 * move response buffering to output handle
 * ConnectorBase
 * simple realm
 * certificate valve
 * snoop servlet with ssl info
 * connection pooling
 * testing with various container combinations

priority 4:

 * PersistentSessionManager and most implementations
 * most realms
 * exception stack trace on demand
 * exception-common distro
 * fastcgi connector
 * syslog logger
 * single signon

priority 5:

 * refactor container classes to more easily support multiple
   protocols; make it so that $WOMBAT_HOME is only needed for
   "standard" (http protocol) containers
 * lifecycle interface
 * webdav servlet
 * localized messages

questionable:
 * require 5.6.1 so isa() works correctly?
 * Log::Dispatch for loggers?
 * consolidated Session package?
 * better random numbers needed for session id generator?
 * authenticator redirect to ssl port when necessary?
 * request dispatcher call back to connector for forward and include?
 * how to set global debug constant from outside Wombat::Globals?
 * per-component debug level?
 * are class loaders interesting? they could manage @INC so
   applications can't load each others' code
